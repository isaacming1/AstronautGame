# AstronautGame
Basic astronaut movement game
My code includes 3 characters. One is still, and the other 2 bounce. There is a random control for the two moving characters to vary speeds. When the astronaut and spongebob hit, they bounce. When spongebob and the pineapple hit, they also bounce. I made a code for a imaginary box so when the icons reach certain distance, they will bounce. I also added code so the icons would not glitch when interacting.
